<h2><hr>Research interest</hr></h2>
	<p>I am interested in the biochemical and molecular study of peptides from amphibians and other organisms. In particular, I am interested in antimicrobial and pharmacological active peptides. Through scientific research I would like to understand the biological function of these molecules from an evolutionary point of view.

	<br> Antimicrobial resistance is a world wide problem. The abuse of antimicrobials and incomplete treatment has lead to the increase of antimicrobial bacteria. In hospital settings the risk of been infected by a resistant pathogen microorganism is even higher. Leaving us sometimes without any treatment available. I am interested in document the antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting and also to analyse the resistance genes asociated with horizontal transmission.

	<br> Amphibian diseases such as chytridiomycosis and ranavirus are associated with amphibian population declines worldwide. I am interested in the diagnosis of these diseases by molecular biology.
